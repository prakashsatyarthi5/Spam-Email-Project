This project aims to build a machine learning model for detecting spam emails using logistic regression. The model is trained on a dataset containing labeled emails categorized as either spam or ham (non-spam). 
The Jupyter Notebook file "Spam Email Project.ipynb" provides a step-by-step implementation of the project, including data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, evaluation, and building a predictive system.
